The objective of this game is to properly identify various molecules as they plummet to their death in an endless abyss.
<br/><br/>
When the game begins, you will see a molecule dropping <font size="5" face="arial" color="red">slowly</font> down the screen. You will also see a sequence of buttons below the screen that shows the molecule. Each of these buttons will be labeled with a name which could be used to classify the molecule you see dropping before you. To play the game, you need to determine which of the possible choices correctly describes the dropping molecule, and <font size="5" face="arial" color="red">quickly</font> click on the button labeled with the name of your choice. 
<br/><br/>
<b><i>Caution: </i></b>Some of the names of the categorizations on the buttons may appear difficult to pronounce. Please do not speculate about how to pronounce them while the game is in progress. Failure to heed this notice may result in a lower game score and subsequent loss of ability to play job submit games.
