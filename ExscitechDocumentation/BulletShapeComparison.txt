btConvexTriangleMeshShape
-Can be Dynamic
-Shares geometry with the source
-Can take multiple indexed vertex lists
-Not recommended by Bullet - use btConvexHullShape instead for performance.

btConvexHullShape
-Can be Dynamic
-Duplicates geometry from source
-Can add one point at a time
-Recommended for performance for any complex convex shape.

btBvhTriangleMeshShape
-Can NOT be Dynamic
