Installing VMD
----------------------------------------------------
Checkout trunk folder as a new project with the new project wizard
Select Makefile project with existing code
In a terminal, navigate to <Project>/MuScripts and run BuildVmd.sh
Your Makefile in vmd-1.8.7/src may have been changed.  Check out the latest from the repository again to ensure you have our copy.
Navigate to vmd-1.8.7/src and locate the Makefile (not the Makefile directly inside vmd-1.8.7) 
Right click, go to Build Target, and click Create
Make the following targets
  -veryclean
  -mocs
  -depend
  -all
run Make in the following order
  make veryclean
  make mocs
  make depend
  make all
  
Once the project is built, we need to set up the Run Configuration.
Click the arrow next to the Run button and go to "Run Configurations..." (Make sure you are in C++ perspective)
Make a new Run Configuration and click the browse button under Project.
Navigate to <Project Directory>/vmd-1.8.7/LINUXAMD64 and select vmd_linuxamd64
Back in the Run Configuration window, go to the Enviornment tab.
Create a new Environment Variable named VMDDIR and set it to <Project Directory>/vmd-1.8.7

You should now be able to run the project through eclipse.
