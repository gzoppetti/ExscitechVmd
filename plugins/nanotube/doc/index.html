<h3>About Nanotube Builder Plugin</h3>

<p>
  Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNs) are cylindrical tubes of carbon
  atoms that can assume a wide range of atomic structures. Each
  structure is defined by two positive integers (n,m) called the chiral
  indices. The Nanotube Builder plugin generates SWCN structures of
  arbitrary length and chirality for the purpose of molecular
  simulations or nanoscience education. This plugin produces the unit
  cell of a SWCN by first generating coordinates of a rectangular
  graphene sheet with dimensions corresponding to the particular chiral
  indices specified by the user. These coordinates are then mapped onto
  a cylinder to generate the SWCN unit cell with its central axis
  aligned in the z-direction. The unit cell is then replicated along the
  z-axis to generate a SWCN of the desired length. The structure is
  loaded into VMD as a new molecule and contains the appropriate box
  dimensions for a SWCN periodic in the z-direction. Below are further
  details on SWCN structure.

<h3>Structure of a SWCN</h3>
<p>
<img style="border: 0; padding: 0 0 1em 1em" src="swcn-construction.png" align="right" alt="SWCN Construction from Graphene Sheet">

  A SWCN can be thought of as a single sheet of graphite (graphene)
  rolled up into a seamless molecular cylinder (see figure on the right). 
  <b>C</b> is the chiral vector and indicates the direction of the rolling.

  <b>C</b> extends from one carbon atom to a crystallographically equivalent
  atom on the graphene lattice. Thus, <b>C</b> can be written as a linear
  combination of the lattice basis vectors:</p>
    <div align="center">
      <b>C</b> = <tt>n</tt> <b>a<sub>1</sub></b> 
      + <tt>m</tt> <b>a<sub>2</sub></b>
    </div>
<p>Here, <tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt> are positive integers known as the chiral 
 indices. All physical properties of a given SWCN ultimately depend on these
 two numbers. SWCNs of different atomic structure result for various choices
 of <tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt> (see figure on the left). High symmetry 
armchair and zigzag SWCNs occur for m = n and m = 0, respectively.</p> 

<p>

  The length of <b>C</b> equals the circumference of the resulting SWCN. 
  Thus, the SWCN diameter <i>d</i> is  given by</p>
<div align="center">
      <i>d</i> = |<b>C</b>| / <i>pi</i> 
      = <i>a</i> sqrt(<tt>n</tt><sup>2</sup> + <tt>n</tt> <tt>m</tt> 
      + <tt>m</tt><sup>2</sup>)
</div>

<p>
 Here, a = 2.49 Angstrom is the lattice constant of the graphene honeycomb 
 lattice.</p>

<p>The translation vector <b>T</b> connects two equivalent carbon atoms 
  along the SWCN axis and is given by</p>

 <div align="center">
      <b>T</b> = [ (2<tt>m</tt> + <tt>n</tt>)<b>a<sub>1</sub></b> 
      -  (<tt>m</tt> + 2<tt>n</tt>) <b>a<sub>2</sub></b>] /
      gcd(2<tt>m</tt> + <tt>n</tt>,<tt>m</tt> + 2<tt>n</tt>)
</div>
<p> where gcd is the greatest common divisor function. The length of <b>T</b>
 gives the length of the SWCN unit cell and can be written as:</p>

 <div align="center">
      |<b>T</b>| = sqrt(3)<i>d</i> /
      gcd(2<tt>m</tt> + <tt>n</tt>,<tt>m</tt> + 2<tt>n</tt>)
</div>
</p>

<h3>Using Nanotube Builder</h3>

<p>Nanotube Builder can be run from the VMD console via the command:</p>

<pre>
    nanotube -l &lt;length&gt; -n &lt;n&gt; -m &lt;m&gt;
</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>length</tt></dt>
      <dd>is the desired length of the nanotube in nanometers (nm).</dd>
      <dt><tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt></dt>
      <dd>are the chiral indices. They should be positive integers.
      </dd>
    </dl>

<p><i>Note:</i> because <b>Nanotube Builder</b> constructs SWCNs by first 
   generating the unit cell, its actual length will be a multiple of the 
   unit cell length determined by the chiral indices.</p>
<p>This plugin can also be run using a GUI located in VMD Extensions
   menu under Modeling/Nanotube Builder.</p>
