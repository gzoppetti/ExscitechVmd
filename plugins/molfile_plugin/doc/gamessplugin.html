<!--#set var="TITLE" value="GAMESS Plugin, Version 0.11"-->
<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads GAMESS output files.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Structural Data</b>
<br>The plugin can parse GAMESS output (*.log) files and
extract structural information. 
<br>Currently we support output
files generated by the following GAMESS runtypes: 
<br>
<br> RUNTYP = ENERGY (extract single point geometry)
<br> RUNTYP = OPTIMIZE (extract trajectory information) 
<br> RUNTYP = SADPOINT (extract trajectory information)
<br>
<br> We plan to support additional runtypes in future releases.
</p>

<p><b>Electron Orbital Data</b>
<br>Presently, we do not support the ability to display
electron orbital data. 
<br>This feature is currently under development and will be 
<br>present in a rudimentary form in Version 0.2 of the plugin.
