<p>This plugin reads molecular coordinate data stored in 
<a href="http://brooks.scripps.edu/charmm_docs/TSRI_docs-list.htm">CHARMM</a>
Cartesian Coordinate format. More information about this file format can be
found at 
<a href="http://pekoe.chem.ukans.edu/~kuczera/Public/web/html/charmm/files/files.html#SECTION00070000000000000000">http://pekoe.chem.ukans.edu/~kuczera/Public/web/html/charmm/files/files.html#SECTION00070000000000000000</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the files created by CHARMM normally carry the extension
<tt>.crd</tt>. Since this extension is also used by 
<a href="crdplugin.html">Amber 7</a> trajectory files, the filetype must be
explicitly set to <tt>cor</tt> when opening a Cartesian Coordinate File in
VMD. This extra step can be omitted by renaming the file and changing the
the extension to <tt>cor</tt>.</p>


<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.</p>

<p><b>Unused data</b>
<br>The <tt>Weight</tt> field, which can be used to store atom-dependent
data such as mass or charge is ignored by VMD.</p>

<p><b>ASCII format</b>
<br>This plugin reads only ASCII, or "formatted" COOR files. Binary
coordinated files produced by CHARMM are presently not supported by VMD.
