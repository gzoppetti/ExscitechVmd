<!--#include virtual="/Research/vmd/include/header-vmd.shtml"-->

<p>This plugin reads in molecular structures in the file format used 
<a href="http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/~schaft/molden/molden.html">by Molden</a>.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
At present, this plugin can only read in the molecular structure data
and doesn't do anything with the orbital data, though we expect to address
this in future versions of the plugin.

<p><b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.</p>
