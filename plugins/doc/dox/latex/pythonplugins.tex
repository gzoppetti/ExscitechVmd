\section{Writing Python based plugins and extensions for VMD}\label{pythonplugins}


\subsection*{Python Modules}
 VMD doesn't do anything particularly special in support of Python modules other than to provide hooks by which they can be  registered in the VMD \char`\"{}Extensions\char`\"{} menu, and subdirectories  in the VMD installation directory where the extensions can be installed.



 Python modules which implement a Tk-based GUI are registered in the  VMD \char`\"{}Extensions\char`\"{} menu by calling {\bf VMD.register\-Extension\-Menu(\char`\"{}My\-Plugin\-Title\char`\"{}, start\-My\-Plugin)}

\subsection*{A minimal Python example plugin}
 

 The example below is an extremely minmalistic Python script that creates a window when triggered by an appropriate selection in the VMD \char`\"{}Extensions\char`\"{} menu.

\small\begin{alltt}
from Tkinter import *

# A minimal plugin class that just creates an empty window
class MyPlugin:
  def __init__(self):
    self.root = Tk()
    self.root.title("My Plugin Window")

# Function to start the plugin.  Must return the window handle.
def startMyPlugin():
  return MyPlugin().root

if __name__=="__main__":
  import VMD
  # Register the plugin so that it's not actually created until the
  # first request to open the window.
  VMD.registerExtensionMenu("myplugin", startMyPlugin)

  # Create the plugin now and add it to the Extensions menu.
  # VMD.addExtensionMenu("myplugin", MyPlugin().root)
\end{alltt}\normalsize
