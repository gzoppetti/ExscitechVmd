\section{Plugin source files and directory structure}\label{filestruct}
 

 The plugin source tree is split into several directories comprised of various shell scripts, C/C++ source code,  Tcl/Python components, link libraries, installers, etc. The list below briefly enumerates the main directories of  interest and what they contain:

\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
The top level directory contains README files, a Makefile simplifying  plugin compilation, and any log files generated during compilation.

\item 
{\bf molfile\_\-plugin}  This directory contains the source code and makefiles for all of the molecule file reader/translator plugins.

\item 
{\bf CVS} This directory is used by the CVS revision control system we use to develop the plugins. It doesn't contain anything of  direct interest to a normal developer.

\item 
{\bf compile}  Compiled plugin object files, header files, shared libraries, and static libraries, split out by target architecture.

\item 
{\bf doc}  Documentation related files

\end{CompactItemize}




\section{Plugin Makefiles and build scripts}\label{buildscripts}
 

 The scripts and Makefiles listed below are of particular interest to people compiling their own plugins: \begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
{\bf build.csh} The build.csh script contains platform-specific configurations and runs a sequence of commands to build plugins on a network of workstations. This file must be customized if it is to be used by people outside of UIUC.

\item 
{\bf Makefile} This makefile contains all of the standard plugin compilations options we use to compile the plugins we distribute with VMD.

\end{CompactItemize}
