VMD topotools package
Copyright (c) by 2009 Axel Kohlmeyer <akohlmey@cmm.chem.upenn.edu>
-------------------

A collection of tcl commands to manipulate and build 
topologies (i.e. bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc. and
their corresponding properties (type, order, etc.).

Please contact me, if you have any additional ideas
or want to implement a specific feature.

TODO:
  - improve "topo setbonds" to be more efficient for large sets 
    of bonds to be added.
  - topo copybonds <fromsel> <tosel>
  - topo guessbonds <sel>  (use bondsrecalc and restore bonds 
    outside the selection)
  - topo guessangles <sel> (use bond info -> assign angle to all 
    pairs of bonds sharing an atom)
  - proper documentation and a tutorial
  - more tools to read/write custom topology files 
    (e.g. gromacs top?, amber parmtop?)
