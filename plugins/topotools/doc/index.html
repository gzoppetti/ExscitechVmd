<h3>Scope and usage</h3>
<p>Starting with VMD version 1.8.7 it is now possible to store the complete topology
information, i.e. not only bonds, but also angle, dihedral, and improper definitions
as well as their force field type labels (if available). This now allows to do
a large variety of modifications to topology data or even building topologies from
scratch. The focus lies hereby on being able to perform many operations manually
or scripted and thus being less focused on and optimized for biomolecules like psfgen.
</p>

<p>In combination with the new command <tt>mol new atoms &lt;number&</tt> it is now
also possible to do many operations directly that previously required writing and 
manipulating temporary files and reading them back into VMD, or even write complete
molecule or simulation data readers in Tcl script. This is especially useful for
file formats, where additional input from the user is required, for example reading
LAMMPS format "data" (=topology) files, where the "style" of the <i>Atoms</i> section
cannot be deduced from the data. Of course write support is also possible.</p>

<p>The underlying Tcl script API in VMD itself had been designed to be minimalistic,
since most operations are not computationally demanding and could be programmed with
scripting. The <b>topotools</b> packages is supposed to provide a <i>middleware</i>, i.e.
flexible script commands that make it easier to use the existing interface.</p>

<p>Finally <b>topotools</b> also contains some utilities and applications for more 
complex operations like combining multiple molecules (=different files) or 
multiple selections into one new molecule, or building larger systems by replicating
a given unitcell.</p>


<h3>Main command interface</h3>
<p>This is the <i>middleware</i> part of the package that provides abstract 
operations on top of the low-level API. This is modeled after the example
of the internal <tt>mol</tt> and <tt>molinfo</tt> command, or the 
<tt>pbc</tt> command from the PBCTools package to provide a somewhat 
consistent interface to the functionality. All command lines start with 
the <tt>topo</tt> keyword and then take a subcommand name to determine
the actual functionality that is requested.</p>

 usage: topo &lt;command&gt; [args...] &lt;flags&gt;
 
 common flags:
   -molid     &lt;num&gt;|top    molecule id (default: 'top')

 flags only applicable to "bond" commands:
   -bondtype  &lt;typename&gt;   bond type name (default: unknown)
   -bondorder &lt;bondorder&gt;  bond order parameter (default: 1)

      including bond order and bond type.
   setbondlist &lt;list&gt; [type|order|both|none]
      resets all bonds from a list in the same
      format as returned by 'topo getbondlist'.
      bond order or -type are reset to defaults if not given.

   num(angle|dihedral|improper)types   returns the number of (angle|dihedral|improper) types

   clear(angle|dihedral|improper)s     deletes all (angle|dihedral|improper)s. 
   sort(angle|dihedral|improper)s      sorts the list of (angle|dihedral|improper)s
                                       according to atom index and removes duplicates

   retype(angle|dihedral|improper)s    resets all angle types. 
 
   addangle &lt;id1&gt; &lt;id2&gt; &lt;id3&gt; [&lt;type&gt;] (re-defines) a single angle.
   delangle &lt;id1&gt; &lt;id2&gt; &lt;id3&gt;  (re-defines) a single angle.
   add(dihedral|improper) &lt;id1&gt; &lt;id2&gt; &lt;id3&gt; &lt;id4&gt; [&lt;type&gt;] (re-defines) a single (dihedral|improper).
   del(dihedral|improper) &lt;id1&gt; &lt;id2&gt; &lt;id3&gt; &lt;id4&gt; (re-defines) a single (dihedral|improper).
 
 
   getanglelist  returns the list of angle definitions
                 in the form {type &lt;id1&gt; &lt;id2&gt; &lt;id3&gt;}
   setanglelist &lt;list&gt;
                 resets angle definitions from a list in the same
                 format as retured by 'topo getanglelist'
   get(dihedral|improper)list  returns the list of (dihedral|improper) definitions
                 in the form {type &lt;id1&gt; &lt;id2&gt; &lt;id3&gt; &lt;id4&gt;}
   set(dihedral|improper)list &lt;list&gt;
                 resets (dihedral|improper) definitions from a list in the same
                 format as retured by 'topo get(dihedral|improper)list'
 
 NOTE: for angle, dihedral, and improper lists, the
       type field currently has to be always present.

   readlammpsdata &lt;filename&gt; [&lt;atomstyle&gt;]
      read atom properties, bond, angle, dihedral and other related data
      from a LAMMPS data file. 'atomstyle' is the value given to the 'atom_style'
      parameter ('angle', 'atomic', 'bond', 'charge', 'full', 'molecular'). default value is 'full'.
      the molecule/selection this info is being added to must have a matching number of atoms.

  writelammpsdata &lt;filename&gt; [&lt;atomstyle&gt;]
      write atom properties, bond, angle, dihedral and other related data
      to a LAMMPS data file. 'atomstyle' is the value given to the 'atom_style'
      parameter ('angle', 'atomic', 'bond', 'charge', 'full', 'molecular'). default value is 'full'.
      Only data that is present is written.

<h3>Utility functions:</h3>
<p>These are useful and convenient tools written on top of the topotools API.
You can access them directly with their <tt>::TopoTools::</tt> namespace
prefix or use <tt>namespace import ::TopoTools::&lt;pattern&gt;</tt> to
import some or all of them into your current namespace.</p>

<h4>mergemols</h4>
Combines multiple separate molecules into one file. Usage:<br>
<pre>
  ::TopoTools::mergemols &lt;list of molecule ids&gt;
</pre>

Example usage:
<pre>
package require topotools 1.0

# load to be merged molecules into VMD
set midlist {}
set mol [mol new part1.psf waitfor all]
mol addfile part1.pdb
lappend midlist $mol
set mol [mol new part2.psf waitfor all]
mol addfile part2.pdb
lappend midlist $mol

# do the magic
set mol [::TopoTools::mergemols $midlist]
animate write psf merged.psf $mol
animate write pdb merged.pdb $mol
</pre>


<h4>selections2mol</h4>
This is very similar to the previous <tt>mergemols</tt> command. It combines 
one or multiple atom selections, which can be taken from different molecules, 
into one new molecule. Usage:<br>
<pre>
  ::TopoTools::selections2mol &lt;list of atom selection functions&gt;
</pre>

Example usage:
<pre>
package require topotools 1.0

set sellist {}
set sel [atomselect 0 protein]
lappend sellist $sel
set sel [atomselect 0 protein]
$sel frame 200
$sel moveby {50.0 50.0 0.0}
lappend sellist $sel
set sel [atomselect 1 "same residue as (within 3.0 of chain L)"]
lappend sellist $sel

# do the magic
set mol [::TopoTools::selections2mol $sellist]
animate write psf combinedsel.psf $mol
animate write pdb combinedsel.pdb $mol
</pre>


<h4>replicatemol</h4>
Replicate the current unitcell according to integer replicate counts.
This currently assumes an orthorhombic cell.
<pre>
package require topotools 1.0

# load a molecule
set mol [mol new pegc12e8-small.xml type hoomd waitfor all]

# do the magic
set newmol [::TopoTools::replicatemol $mol 2 2 1 ]
animate write hoomd replicated.xml $newmol
</pre>
